# Hybrid Work Security Assessment

Thompson Rivers University, Co-op

It is with TRU's (Thompson Rivers University's) permission that I make this public on GitHub.

The Hybrid Work Security Assessment (HWSA) checks if individual devices (clients) meet TRU's security standards. Passing the HWSA is a mandatory requirement for joining the Hybrid Work Program. HIPS rules are reviewed separately, regularly, and asynchronously. The HWSA is specifically designed as a flexible tool to interact with this process, allowing it to be easily reconfigured when the process undergoes changes.
